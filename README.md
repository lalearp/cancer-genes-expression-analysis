# cancer-genes-expression-analysis
In this project, I used the GSE13507 dataset to analyze gene expression differences between normal and cancer tissues. However, the dataset is relatively small and imbalanced. If I had worked with a larger and more balanced dataset—such as TCGA or GSE25066—the classification performance could have improved significantly.
